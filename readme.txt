Sales Tax program contains two Java files. TaxMainProg and PurchaseItem.

TaxMainProg contains the main method along with outputting the results on the screen

PurchaseItem contains the calculations for tax as well as a string to be called by TaxMainProg to print out the total tax and total cost with tax inclucded on the screen.

This program can be run using Netbeans IDE/ Eclipse for testing purposes.

Just letting you know, I made this program very simple.  I hope it meets up with the coding challenge criteria Thank you.
